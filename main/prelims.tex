\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chap:prelims}

A preliminaries chapter is not necessary, but it may be a good idea to use it for presenting your theoretical/mathematical framework in a more detailed and technical way than the introduction, and to perhaps establish some basic lemmata/observations common to multiple chapters of your thesis.

\section{Some section}

Let's define some concept we'll be using throughout the thesis.

\begin{definition}
The \emph{von Neumann model} of a computer, also known as the \emph{Princeton architecture} is an architecture for digital computers, which consists of a processing units, containing an ALU and processing registers; a control unit consisting of an instruction register and a program counter; a memory unit which stores both data and instructions; and input-and-output mechanisms.
