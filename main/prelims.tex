\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chap:prelims}

As a preliminary discussion to the presentation of out contribution, we overview some the key theoretical basis of the thesis.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:prlm_propWaveField}, the wave propagation, being the most basic concept for array processing, is discussed.
It is then followed by a short overview of array-processing in Sec.~\ref{sec:prlm_sensorArrays}.
To accommodate the discussion for spatial filtering, we also mention the time-space relation of spatially sampled signals in Sec.~\ref{sec:prlm_timeSpaceSig}.
As an additional theoretical concept, arriving from the information theory, which will be used in the main chapter (Ch.~\ref{chap:firstchap}), is the Fisher Information Matrix, covered in Sec.~\ref{sec:prlm_FIM}.

For an easier reading treat each section as independent, where notations and symbols are each defined in the specific section and are not mutual, nor used in the main chapter.

% The \emph{von Neumann model} of a computer, also known as the \emph{Princeton architecture} is an architecture for digital computers, which consists of a processing units, containing an ALU and processing registers; a control unit consisting of an instruction register and a program counter; a memory unit which stores both data and instructions; and input-and-output mechanisms.
