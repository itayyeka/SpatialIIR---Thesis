In practical RADAR related systems, the waveform of choice is pulse (chirp) based.
It holds some obvious advantages over the CW transmission such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower power consumption
    \item Possible match filters should allow the decision of weather to re-transmit or not
    \item In multi target scenario, there is a smaller chance of interference.
    \item The most interesting research option is the use of several (possibly many) independent harmonics as super positioned multiple dual frequency beamformers, which simultaneously scan a wide area with multiple resolutions, by merely selecting harmonic couples and filter coefficients, where each harmonic/coefficient set it pointed to a specific area.
    In the expense of computational effort (without adding elements to the array), it seems possible that one may have simultaneous scan of the entire arena in any wanted direction/range/resolution by mere choosing multiple frequency couples which are simultaneously processed independently.
    \par 
    As a simple example, consider that the arena consists of $M$ zones of interest, where each zone may be described as a angular bounded radial slice (similar to the visualization of Fig.~\ref{fig_rangeAzimuthSelectivity}) which may be described as $$a_{m}=\cBrace{\vecnot{p}\ \middle\vert\  \theta_{d,m,\text{min}}<\text{DOA}\rBrace{\vecnot{p}}<\theta_{d,m,\text{max}}\ ,\ R_{m,\text{min}}<\norm{\vecnot{p}}<R_{m,\text{max}}}\ \forall\ m=0\dots{}M-1.$$
    \par
    Each zone will be assigned with matching couple of carrier frequencies ($\omega_{1,2}$) to cover its radial width (where the radial width is equivalent to $R_{\text{rt}}$ of \eqref{eq_DF_phErr}) and coefficient sets ($\vecnot{\alpha}_{m,i},\vecnot{\beta}_{m,i} \ \forall\ m=0\dots{}M-1, i=1,2$), which cover the zone's angular diameter which is equivalent to determining the desired beamwidth via setting the proper $\kappa$ of \eqref{eqn_H_DF_CB}.
    \par
    Leaving aside the needed computational effort and physical limitations of transmitting multiple narrowband signals, assuming large $M$ values, we have a super-positioned feedback beamformer which simultaneously scans the entire arena.
