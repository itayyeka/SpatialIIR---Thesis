In practical RADAR related systems, the waveform of choice is pulse (chirp) based.
It holds some obvious advantages over the CW transmission such as
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower power consumption
    \item Inherent nulling in the radial axis (localization)
    \item Possible match filters should allow the decision of weather to re-transmit or not
    \item In multi target scenario, there is a smaller chance of interference.
    \item The most interesting research option is the use of several (possibly many) independent harmonics as super positioned multiple dual frequency beamformers, which simultaneously scan a wide area with multiple resolutions, by merely selecting harmonic couples and filter coefficients, where each harmonic/coefficient set it pointed to a specific area.
    In the expense of computational effort (without adding elements to the array), it seems possible that one may have simultaneous scan of the entire arena in any wanted direction/range/resolution.
\end{itemize}
