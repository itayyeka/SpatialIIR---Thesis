% In array signal processing, propagating waves carry signals from the source to the array.
% Therefore, these signals are represented in the time-space domain. The space domain is represented by either the three dimensional Cartesian coordinates $\rBrace{x,y,z}$ or the three dimensional spherical coordinates $\rBrace{r,\phi,\theta}$, where $0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi$, $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ are the azimuth and elevation angles, respectively. The time domain is represented by $t$.
An elementary physical phenomenon is the spatial dynamics of waves, referred to as wave-propagation.
The spatial location is noted by the Cartesian coordinates $\rBrace{x,y,z}$ or the three dimensional spherical coordinates $\rBrace{r,\phi,\theta}$, where $0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi$, $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ are the azimuth and elevation angles, respectively. 
% Finally, let $f\rBrace{t,\vecnot{r}}$ denote the time-space representation of the input signal, where $\vecnot{r}$ is the radius-vector in the three-dimensional system. 
% The relations between the Cartesian and spherical coordinates are given in Fig.~\ref{fig_coordinates}.
Denoting $t$ as the time, the time-space representation of the a signal is $f\rBrace{t,\vecnot{r}}$ or , where the relations between the Cartesian and spherical coordinates are given in Fig.~\ref{fig_coordinates}.
% $f\rBrace{t,x,y,z}$ describes the signal impinging the microphone array. 
In a homogeneous, dispersion free and lossless medium the wave equation is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_prlm_waveEq}
\nabla^{2}f\rBrace{t,x,y,z}=\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^{2}f\rBrace{t,x,y,z}}{\partial{t^{2}}}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla^{2}$ is the Laplacian operator and $c$ represents the wave's velocity in the medium.

\end{figure}
A possible solution to \eqref{eq_prlm_waveEq}, $f_p\rBrace{t,x,y,z}$, may be of a complex exponential form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_prlm_waveEq_pSol}
f_p\rBrace{t,x,y,z} = A\exp{j\rBrace{\omega{t}-k_{x}x-k_{y}y-k_{z}z}}
\end{equation}
Where $A$ is a complex constant, $\omega$ denotes temporal radial frequency and $k_{x}x,k_{y},k_{z}$ are real constants. 
Plugging \eqref{eq_prlm_waveEq_pSol} into \eqref{eq_prlm_waveEq} results in the \emph{monochromatic plane wave}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_prlm_waveEq_subs}
k_{x}^{2}-k_{y}^{2}-k_{z}^{2} = \frac{\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}.
\end{equation}
Using the plane wave notation emphasizes the fact that for a given time, $t_{0}$, all points on a plane given by $k_{x}x+k_{y}y+k_{z}z = constant$ are with the same wave value and the vector notation of \eqref{eq_prlm_waveEq}'s solution is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_prlm_waveEq_finSol}
f\rBrace{t,\vecnot{x}}=A\exp{j\rBrace{\omega{t}-\vecnot{k}\vecnot{x}}}.
\end{equation}
where $\vecnot{k}\vecnot{x}=constant$ are planes of constant wave value.
The wave propagation can be described as the traveling of the planes, stating that small steps of both space $\delta{\vecnot{x}}$ and time $\delta{t}$ result in the same wave value i.e. $f\rBrace{t+\delta{t},\vecnot{x}+\delta{\vecnot{x}}} = f\rBrace{t,\vecnot{x}}$, which yields
\begin{equation}
\omega\delta{t}-\vecnot{k}\delta\vecnot{x}=0.
\end{equation}
Assuming $\delta\vecnot{x}$ and $\vecnot{k}$ have the same direction, $\vecnot{k}\delta\vecnot{x} = \abs{\vecnot{k}}\abs{\delta\vecnot{x}}$ and $\frac{\delta{\vecnot{x}}}{\delta{t}} = \frac{\omega}{\abs{\vecnot{k}}}$, where $\frac{\delta{\vecnot{x}}}{\delta{t}}$ can designate the propagation speed of the plane wave. 
Since $\vecnot{k}$ and $\omega$ are related by $\abs{\vecnot{k}}^{2}=\frac{\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq_prlm_waveEq_stepsEq}
\frac{\delta{\vecnot{x}}}{\delta{t}}=c,
\end{equation}
where $c>0$ is the wave velocity in the medium.
The \emph{wavelength} ($\lambda$) denote the distance the plane wave propagated during a single temporal period of $T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$.
Let $\vecnot{k}$ denote the \emph{wavelength vector}. 
Its magnitude $\abs{\vecnot{k}}$ expresses the number of cycles in radians per meter of length that the plane wave has exhibited in the propagation direction.
Using \eqref{eq_prlm_waveEq_stepsEq} with $\delta{t} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$, we obtain:
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\delta{\vecnot{x}}=\frac{2\pi}{\abs{\vecnot{k}}}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the wavenumber vector can be considered to represent spatial frequency, similarly to the manner $\omega$ represents temporal frequency.
\par For example, in the context of ULA, assuming far field scenario, the impinging waves are treated as constant phase planes as in \eqref{eq_prlm_waveEq_finSol}.
The spatial diversity of the ULA elements is expressed as a TOA difference of the impinging signal in each sensor which is will be shown to provide clues for the signal's DOA as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig_ULA_sketch}.

When also considering the narrowband scenario, where TOA difference is merely phase shift, it seems obvious that by phase measuring, one should be able to extract the DOA from the spatially sampled data.
